# ENTER THE HYPNODOME!!!

### ~Two men enter, one man leave~

So, I have decided to make something. A thing is inspired by a truly
breathtaking artwork I saw at Burning Man 2015.

### The Plan

I want to build a geodesic dome, the facets of which will comprise nets of RGB
LEDs. The floor will be nicely carpeted or similarly furnished so that visitors
can lie, with their heads at the center of the floor, looking up at the ceiling.

The LED nets will display a light show so that it fills the vision of the
visitors from edge to edge. At first the light show will be pre-rendered and
ideally synchronised to a soundtrack, the long-term goal is to make the light
show more interactive, using microphone pickups to procedularlly generate the
show from sound/music.
